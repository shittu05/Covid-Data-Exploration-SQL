# Covid-Data-Exploration-SQL
I used a variety of SQL commands to query, investigate, and analyze data on COVID-19. The data include information related to the number of cases, deaths, recoveries, vaccination, and other related metrics around the world. SQL is a powerful tool for data analysis; it allows users to filter, sort, and aggregate data in a variety of ways. Through my investigation and analysis of the data, I was able to gain insights into the impact of the pandemic in different regions, as well as identify trends and patterns in the data.
## Some of the questions I investigated includes:
- Total number of covid cases and death in the United States and other countries
- Total Cases vs Population (the percentage of population infected with Covid) in each countries and region
- Countries with Highest Infection Rate compared to its Population
- Countries with Highest Death Count per Population
- Contintents with the highest death count per population
- Total Population vs Vaccinations (Percentage of Population that recieved at least one Covid Vaccine in each countries and region)
